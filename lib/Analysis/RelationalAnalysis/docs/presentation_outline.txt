Introduction/Paper outline/Task:
@Vanessa
- implement pass in llvm framework for relational analysis
- Non functional requirements:
  * Code has to be maintainable/extendable (through abstraction)
  * Algorithm runtime has to be short

- EQ Domain stores invariants about vars of the form (a = b, c = 2)
  -> transform funcs in EQ Domain
    [x <- ?]#: ...
    [x <- c]# (a=b .. a=2 -> a=b=2)
    [x <- y]#
